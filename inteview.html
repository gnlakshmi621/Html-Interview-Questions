    <h4>1. Difference between div and span?</h4>
    <p><div> tag stands for division tag and it is block-level element means it is bound
to take the whole width of the screen. Its default CSS “display” property is
“display : block”.
<span> tag is an inline element means it only takes the space that is required for
the content.. Its default CSS “display” property is “display : inline”.
Div is a block element and it acquires the entire width so the next element
which will come, will always come in the next line. Whereas Span is an inline
element, it acquires only the width which is required for the content so the next
element will be starting from the same line only.

<table border="3"  width="40%" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
     <td>This is block one</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
        <td>This is block two</td>
    </tr>
    <table border="3"  width="40%" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">This is inline element one</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<p>In HTML, the differences between class and ID is :
    ● One element can have more than one class i.e. class = “box box1”. On
    the other hand, one element can have only one id i.e. id = “heading ● IDs are unique which means you can not give one id to multiple elements.
    On the otherhand classes are not unique we can use same class on
    multiple elements.
    ● When we style an element using class we use class = “box” .box{}. On
    the other hand to style an element using id we use id = “heading”
    #heading

    <h4>3. What are self-closing tags and empty elements?</h4>
    <p>In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not be closed by closing
        tag, which means there is no separate closing tag for it as </tag>.
        Normal tags require opening and closing tags both like <div> is an opening tag
        and </div> is a closing tag.
        Elements that don't have any content are called empty elements.
        <br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line
        break).
        Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.
        Example: <img /> , <input /> , <br />, <hr />
    </p>
